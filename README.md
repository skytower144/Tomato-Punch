# Tomato-Punch
<br />
Punchout inspired RPG game on development. <br /><br />
Developing with Unity.<br />
Development start : August 2021.<br /><br /><br />

* Development Background:

I was first introduced to the "Punchout" game while playing "Enter the Gungeon".<br />
Something sparked within me as I got smacked by the rat countless times.<br /><br />
I loved RPG games as well, exploring new regions and diving into a storyline.<br />
What if I replaced turn-based combat into a Punchout format?<br />
The concept of a RPG game based on real-time fighting sequences seemed suddenly very interesting to me.<br /><br />
So here I begin!<br /><br />
